Description: Multi-parametric flow and mass cytometry allows exceptional high-resolution exploration of the
  cellular composition of the immune system. Together with tools like FlowSOM and Cytosplore it is possible to 
  identify novel cell types. By introducing cytofast we hope to offer a workflow for visualization
  and quantification of cell clusters for an efficient discovery of cell populations associated
  with diseases or other clinical outcomes.
